# Pull requests suck

They suck so badly. Real bad.

I guess monitor default branch _and_ `refs/pull/*/head` is required on the VCS thingie _to enable downstream PR triggering_.

I can exclude using `-:<default>` and that stops those yellow notication thingies (at least).

Don't actually need agents to exercise triggers.

Normal edits do not trigger pull requests.
