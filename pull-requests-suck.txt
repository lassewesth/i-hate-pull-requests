# Pull requests suck

They suck so badly. Real bad.

I guess monitor default branch _and_ `refs/pull/*/head` is required on the VCS thingie _to enable downstream PR triggering_.

I can exclude using `-:<default>` and that stops those yellow notication thingies (at least).

Don't actually need agents to exercise triggers.

Normal edits do not trigger pull requests.

You can filter on VCS root to exclude pull requests: `+:<default>`

VCS branch filter for pull requests _still_ not working!

it works!

only tiny problem is, there are 2x VCS declarations in play:
 - one in build-something that checks out into shite folder
 - one in pr triggered build that checkout out in root of checkout dir

This is not a problem per se; I can't see a way around it; just have to manage the situation.

Wait! Maybe a rule like `-:*`? Let's play!

Ok it's actually `-:.` but who's counting...

Aight yes mate now for that extra stuff innit!?

So that rule about `-:.` _might_ have stopped triggers? So now doing `+:. => devnull` which has same effect

Just one more, to blow smoke through the pipes...

Question: does foo pr cause bar build? (guessing yes)

Numbers for names won't work for filtering, can we do better?

OK! Trying PR triggers using branch name prefix...

Pull Requests build feature might not leave Git metadata, so let's also look at plain old `refs/pull/*/head` style branch specification...

Alrighty! A foo-PR to test guard

Test guard and figure out how to hide that yellow "pending" label...
