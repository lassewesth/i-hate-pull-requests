# Pull requests suck

They suck so badly. Real bad.

I guess monitor default branch _and_ `refs/pull/*/head` is required on the VCS thingie _to enable downstream PR triggering_.

I can exclude using `-:<default>` and that stops those yellow notication thingies (at least).

Don't actually need agents to exercise triggers.

Normal edits do not trigger pull requests.

You can filter on VCS root to exclude pull requests: `+:<default>`

VCS branch filter for pull requests _still_ not working!

it works!

only tiny problem is, there are 2x VCS declarations in play:
 - one in build-something that checks out into shite folder
 - one in pr triggered build that checkout out in root of checkout dir

This is not a problem per se; I can't see a way around it; just have to manage the situation.

Wait! Maybe a rule like `-:*`? Let's play!

Ok it's actually `-:.` but who's counting...

Aight yes mate now for that extra stuff innit!?
